# How to contribute to the project

Every modification made to the project must be done with the following steps:

- Update the README.md (and eventually any other "md" file such as "TROUBLESHOUTING.md")
- Update the version number in composer.json file
- Create a new tag with the same version number
- Update the vendor in orangelu/orangelucloud to get the last version
